## Project Title:
Implementing an LFSR onto a Lattice FPGA Board

## Project Description:
The goal of this Project is to create a step-by-step tutorial to implement an LFSR onto a new board - The Lattice iCEbreaker V1. Once that is complete we will design a full lab, similar to the ones utilized in class, that can be ran through by new FPGA students with no issues.
## Key Objectives:
- Download Software for Lattice FPGA Board
- Implement LFSR onto the FPGA Board
- Create a fully operational lab using the steps that we ourselves used.

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)

## Expected Outcomes:
We hope to deliver a finished lab that will allow any student with the FPGA Board to run an LFSR without the need of outside assistance.

## Tasks:
Garrett Delaney - Design the LFSR Verilog code, design the initial tutorial to download and run the necessary software onto the board, debugging.
Nick Flora- Design the LFSR Verilog code, design the initial tutorial to download and run the necessary software onto the board, debugging, first run of downloading software that would be used with board
Robert Smith - Introduction, Background, Questions, will be running through the tutorial after creation to confirm the tasks, make sure it can be done without any outside help
## Timeline:
4/11 - Fully implement the Background, Introduction, and other initial parts into the tutorial. Have the Verilog fully completed and able to be ran on the board.
4/18 - Fully write the lab with all instructions in one place, confirm that the board works with no issues and that it can be run.
4/18 - Finalize any tests or bugs that need to be made, confirm that it can be run without outside assistance by having Robert run through the lab without the software downloaded.
4/25 - Finalize whatever is necessary to complete the assignment.
